USER MANUAL:

How to use Shop Managment System for making smarter business decisions:



'Gains' provides a measure of potential profit from an item.

It is the product of an item's market demand and profit-per-item.

- High Demand (HD) and High Profit (HP) items will have the highest Gains.

- Low Demand (LD) and Low Profit (LD) items will have lowest Gains.

- HD-LP and LD-HP items will have Gains inbetween.



Products Comparision:

Compare multiple items based on their gains to decide which products to discontinue and which ones to invest more into.



Market Analysis:

Imagine you want to introduce a new product in your store, but you are unsure about its market potential.

Without investing, you can add it in the system with 0 'available stock' and track its demand.

Then with enough data and wether or not it meets your desired gains, you can decide to invest in this item or not.



Inventory Management:

- Get early reminders to restock when inventory of an item falls below a minimum level.

- Get insights about potential loss due to not being able to meet demand for an item.
